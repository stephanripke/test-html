It's another lonely evening 
In another lonely town 
But I ain't too young to worry 
And I ain't too old to cry 
When a woman gets me down

 
Got another empty bottle 
Mmh and another empty bed 
 Ain't too young to admit it
And I'm not too old to lie
I'm just another empty head 

 
 Mmh, that's why I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm going to do 

 
 I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
(Ride on) standing on the edge of the road
(Ride on) thumb in the air
(Ride on) one of these days I'm gonna change my evil ways
'Til then I'll just keep riding on 

 
Broke another promise 
 And I broke another heart
But I ain't too young to realize
That I ain't too old to try
Try to get back to the start 

 
 And it's another red-light nightmare
Woah, an' another red-light street  
 And I ain't too old to hurry
'Cause I ain't too old to die
But I sure am hard to beat 

 
 But I'm lonely
Lord, I'm lonely  
What am I gonna do?

 
 got myself a one-way ticket
(Ride on) goin' the wrong way
(Ride on)
(Ride on) gonna change my evil ways
(Ride on)
One of these days  
One of these days

 
 I'm gonna
(Ride on)
(Ride on) mmh, lookin' for a truck
(Ride on) Mmh
(Ride on) keep on riding  
Ridin' on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on 
 have myself a good time
(Ride on) mmh, yeah
(Ride on) ride, ride, ride
(Ride on) one of these days

An old man turned 98

He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
And isn't it ironic, don't you think?



It's like rain on your wedding day

It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought, it figures  


 Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down, he thought
Well, isn't this nice?

And isn't it ironic, don't you think?

Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you

When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up
In your face  




 A traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife


And isn't it ironic, don't you think?
A little too ironic

There are places I'll remember
In my life though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

And of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares to you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

No hell below us

Imagine all the people

Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people
Livin' life in peace


You may say I'm a dreamer

But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one

Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world

The kiss my lover brings

Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.



Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.





And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.





Hey Jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.





So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
You're waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.





Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you


She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you


And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years


You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you


[ref]


You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a Valentine
Birthday greetings bottle of wine  


 If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four  


 You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you  




 I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride


Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more  
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four  


 Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck and Dave  




 Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away  


 Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four

Ah, look at all the lonely people (x2)



Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?


All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?


Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

Flew in from Miami Beach B.O.A.C
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight


I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the U.S.S.R


Been away so long, I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it 'til tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey, disconnect the phone

Back in the U.S

Back in the U.S.S.R


Well The Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my, my mind


Hey, I'm back In the U.S.S.R

You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the U.S.S.R


Well The Ukraine girls really knock me out

Oh, show me 'round your snow-peaked mountains
Way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night

Blackbird singing in the dead of night
To take these sunken eyes and learn to see, hmm
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Now it looks as though they′re here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There′s a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly  


Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed on to the sun
'Til we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine 

 
 We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine 

 
 And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

 As we live a life of ease 
Every one of us
Has all we need
Sky of blue 
And sea of green 
In our yellow 
Submarine

[Intro]


When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be 

 
 Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be 

 
 And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be

For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be 

 
 Let it be [...] 2x


[interlude]

 
 And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shinin' until tomorrow, let it be

I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be 

 
 And let it be [...]

And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see

No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me 

 
 So darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me

Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea

Sind so kleine Hände
winzge Finger dran.
Darf man nie drauf schlagen
die zerbrechen dann. 

 
 Sind so kleine Füße
mit so kleinen Zehn.
Darf man nie drauf treten
könn sie sonst nicht gehn. 

 
 Sind so kleine Ohren
scharf, und ihr erlaubt.
Darf man nie zerbrüllen
werden davon taub. 

 
 Sind so kleine Münder
sprechen alles aus.
Darf man nie verbieten
kommt sonst nichts mehr raus. 

 
 Sind so klare Augen
die noch alles sehn.
Darf man nie verbinden
könn sie nichts verstehn. 

 
 Sind so kleine Seelen
offen und ganz frei.
Darf man niemals quälen
gehn kaputt dabei. 

 
 Ist son kleines Rückrat
sieht man fast noch nicht.
Darf man niemals beugen
weil es sonst zerbricht. 

 
 Grade, klare Menschen
wärn ein schönes Ziel.
Leute ohne Rückrat
hab'n wir schon zuviel.

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she's goes away 

 
 Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away 

 
 And I know, I know, I know, I know (cont)


Hey, I ought to leave young thing alone

But ain't no sunshine when she's gone, whoa-whoa 

 
 Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away (x3)

By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, No


When I feel heavy metal
(Woo-hoo) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woo-hoo) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you




I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, be happy now …. 

 
 Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy 


I give your my phone number, if you worry, call me anytime 

 
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style

Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy

 
 Now there is this song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note, like good little children
Dn't worry, be happy
Now listen to what I said, in your life expect some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
But don't worry, be happy, be happy now 

 
Put a smile in your face, don't bring everybody down like this 


It will soon pass, whatever it is

Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart


Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start


I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
But tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are


Nobody said [...]
I'm going back to the start 


Aaaahh.  Ooooohhhh

The lights go out and I can't be saved
Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead
Singin' come out of things un said
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'  


 You are
You are 

 
 Confusion that never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know
Singin' come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease? Singin' 

 
 You are

 I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own 

 
 I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead, long live the king
One minute, I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
   
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world 

 
 It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Aw, who would ever wanna be king? 

 
 I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world 

 
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Give me real, don't give me fake  
 Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Give me time, give us a kiss
And tell me your own politik

Give me peace of mind and trust

Ooh-....

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreamed of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Ooh-.....

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

And dream of para-, para-, paradise...

La, la-la, la-la-la...



So lying underneath those stormy skies
She said, Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, I know the sun must set to rise

This could be para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise...

This could be para-, para-, paradise...

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh...

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse 

 

 And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse? 

 

 Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you 

 
 And high up above, or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth 

 

 Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you 

 

 Tears stream down your face

When you lose something you cannot replace

Tears stream down your face, and I 


 

 Tears stream down your face
I 
promise you I will learn from my mistakes

Tears stream down your face, and I 

 

 Lights will guide you home

One gets torn apart
One gets a broken heart

I know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain
Girl I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl you know I've done all I can
You see I beg, stole, and I borrowed
Yeah!


That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning


I wanna be high
So high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free
Just me
Oh baby!

Left a good job in the city
Workin′ for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin′ 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin′
Rollin′, rollin', rollin′ on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

Big wheel keep on turnin′  [...]

Rollin′, rollin′ (yeah), rollin' on the river

If you come down to the river
Bet you′re gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry ′cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel keep on turnin' [...]

Rollin′, rollin' (yeah), rollin′ on the river
Rollin' (yeah), rollin′, rollin' on the river

Thank you

Right now, we′d like to do an old Screamin' Jay Hawkins tune for ya

Du bist wirklich saudumm</a>
Darum geht's dir gut</a>
Hass ist deine Attitüde
Ständig kocht dein Blut</a>
Alles muss man dir erklären
Weil du wirklich gar nichts weißt
Höchstwahrscheinlich nicht einmal
Was Attitüde heißt</a>


Deine Gewalt ist nur ein stummer Schrei nach Liebe</a>
Deine Springerstiefel sehnen sich nach Zärtlichkeit</a>
Du hast nie gelernt, dich zu artikulieren</a>
Und deine Eltern hatten niemals für dich Zeit</a>
Oh-ho-ho, Arschloch!</a>



Warum hast du Angst vorm Streicheln?</a>
Was soll all der Terz?
Unterm Lorbeerkranz mit Eicheln</a>
Weiß ich, schlägt dein Herz
Und Romantik ist für dich
Nicht bloß graue Theorie
Zwischen Störkraft</a> und den Onkelz</a>
Steht 'ne Kuschelrock-LP</a>

   Weil du Probleme hast, die keinen intressieren
Weil du Schiss vorm Schmus'n hast, bist du ein Faschist</a>
Du musst deinen Selbsthass nicht auf andre projizieren
Damit keiner merkt, was für ein lieber Kerl du bist (Oh-ho-ho)


  Deine Gewalt ist nur ein stummer Schrei nach Liebe
Deine Springerstiefel sehnen sich nach Zärtlichkeit
Du hast nie gelernt, dich artizukulieren</a>
Und deine Freundin, die hat niemals für dich Zeit
Oh-ho-ho, Arschloch! Arschloch! Arschloch!</a>

Und das Plastikobst, von dem du dich optisch ernährst

Ich will deinen Kopf, ich will deine Zunge
Ich will deine Haare, ich will deine Haut

Der Zorn, der nicht richtig verraucht
Und die verschusselten Träume, von denen am Morgen nichts bleibt

Ich nehm deine Katze und schüttel sie aus
Bis alles herausfällt
Was sie jemals aus meiner Hand fraß
Später klopf ich noch den Teppich aus

Und find ich ein Haar von mir darin
Dann steck ich es einfach ein
Nichts soll dir böse Erinnerung sein
Verraten was ich dir gewesen bin 

 
 Sag nicht, dass das gar nicht nötig wär
Denn schmerzhaft wird es erst hinterher
Wenn wieder hochkommt was früher mal war
Dann lieber so rein und so dumm sein wie weißes Papier 

 
 Auch werd ich in Zukunft ein anderer sein
Als der, den du in mir sahst
Die Hose die du mir gehäkelt hast
Werf ich in den Container der Heilsarmee rein 

 
 Ich ess auf dem Fußboden, aus der Hand
Seh mir jeden Trickfilm im Fernseh'n an
Alles was du nicht magst, lobe ich mir
Ich werd einfach so rein und so dumm sein wie weißes Papier 

 
 Nicht mal das Meer darf ich wiederseh'n
Wo der Wind deine Haare vermisst
Wo jede Welle ein Seufzer
Und jedes Sandkorn ein Blick von dir ist 

 
 Am liebsten wär ich ein Astronaut
Und flöge auf Sterne wo gar nichts vertraut
Und versaut ist durch eine Berührung von dir
Ich werd nie mehr so rein und so dumm sein wie weißes Papier

In den See deiner Wünsche

Verbring' dann den Tag
Mit dem Kämmen deiner Haare 

 
 Kauf' dir ein Halsband aus Samt
Leg' es mir um
Und führ' mich herum
Im Gestrüpp deines Denkens
Und sieh' zu, wie ich mich verhak'
Verbring' dann den Tag
Mit dem Feilen deiner Nägel 

 
 Kauf' dir einen Ofen aus Glas
Heize ihn ein
Und leg' mich hinein
In das Feuer deines Zornes
Und sieh' zu wie ich's ertrag'
Verbring' dann den Tag

Saying I love you

Is not the words I want to hear from you

It's not that I want you
Not to say but if you only knew


How easy, it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know


What would you do
If my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real


What would you say
If I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you


La-di-da, da-di-da
Di-dai-dai-da
More than words
La-di-da, da-di-da





Now that I've tried to
Talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands 


and touch me Hold me close, don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know


What would you do
[...]

Alles hohl und hundsgemein
Auf Skoda oder Fiorucci
Flieg ich nicht mehr ein
Da bleib ich kühl, kein Gefühl

Bloß deine blauen Augen machen mich so sentimental, so blaue Augen
Wenn du mich so anschaust wird mir alles andre egal, total egal
Deine blauen Augen sind phänomenal, kaum zu glauben
Was ich dann so fühle ist nicht mehr normal

Das ist gefährlich
Lebensgefährlich
Zu viel Gefühl




  Insiderfeten, da schlaf ich ein
Ich will auch nicht in London sein
Bei sex and drugs and rock'n roll
Ist das meist ein stumpfer Einfall
Da bleib ich kühl, kein Gefühl

Der ganze Hassel um die Knete
Macht mich taub und stumm
Für den halben Luxus
Leg ich mich nicht krumm
Nur der Scheich ist wirklich reich

Und deine blauen Augen machen mich so sentimental, so blaue Augen
Wenn du mich so anschaust wird mir alles andre egal, total egal
Deine blauen Augen sind phänomenal, kaum zu glauben
Was ich dann so fühle ist nicht mehr normal

Das ist gefährlich
Lebensgefährlich
Zu viel Gefühl

I see trees of green, Red roses too
I see them bloom, For me and for you
And I think to myself, What a wonderful world


I see skies of blue, And clouds of white
The bright blessed day, The dark sacred night
And I think to myself, What a wonderful world


The colors of the rainbow, So pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces, Of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, Saying, How do you do?
They′re really saying, “I love you


I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more, Than I′ll ever know
And I think to myself, What a wonderful world

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby


Somewhere over the rainbow, Skies are blue,
And the dreams that you dare to dream, really do come true...


Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me


Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly

Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh why can't I?

After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake


Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink




I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I


Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I


Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me


I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I


He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms




Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink


I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I


I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I


When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best


Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again

Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I


Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more


Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more


Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there


Romance, finis, your chance, finis
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more	##lyrics_jazz-standard

Georgia, Georgia
The whole day through
Just an old sweet song
Keeps Georgia on my mind


I said-a Georgia, Georgia

A song of you
Comes as sweet and clear
As moonlight through the pines


Other arms reach out to me
Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you


I said Georgia. Oh Georgia
 no peace I find
Just an old sweet song

The perfect combination and it couldn′t be better

I'll sing till the sun rises high
Carnival time is here
Magical time of year
And as the time draws near
Dreams left my heart


I′ll sing while I play my guitar
I'll cling to this dream from afar
Will true love come my way
On this Carnival day
Or will love stay here in my heart?

On this Carnival day,

Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, just holding your hand


Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty whenever you're near


Don't you know that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do
Can't you see that I'm hopelessly lost?
That's why I'm following you


On my own
When I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love	##lyrics_jazz-standard play_and_melody

My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart



Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art



Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?



But don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me

My ship has sails that are made of silk
The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin;
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky
When my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much
If there's missing just one thing:

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be
If the ship i sing
Doesn't also bring
My own true love to me

The autumn leaves of red and gold

And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling

Try to think that love's not around
Still it's uncomfortably near

Because my Angel Eyes ain't here

They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's mis-spent
Mis-spent with Angel Eyes tonight




So drink up all you people
And order anything you see
Have fun you happy people

The drink, and the laugh's, on me




Pardon me, but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now number one
And why my Angel Eyes ain't here.

You are the promised kiss of springtime,
That makes the lonely winter seem long.

You are the breathless hush of evening,
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.

You are the angel glow that lights a star,
The dearest things I know are what you are.



Some day my happy arms will hold you,
And some day I′ll know that moment divine.

When all the things you are are mine 	##lyrics_jazz-standard ##lyrics_samiha

All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I want to lose them
Take my arms, I'll never use them


Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on, dear, without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?	##lyrics_jazz-standard

I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah


Well your faith was strong but you needed proof

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah


Baby, I've been here before

I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah


Well, there was a time when you let me know

What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?
But remember, when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah


Maybe there's a God above

But, all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you?
And it's not a cry, that you hear at night
It's not somebody, who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

That Arizona sky burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find


So when I'm all choked up
And I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts

When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way




Lovers in the night
Poets tryin' to write
We don't know how to rhyme
But, damn, we try

But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die


So when I'm all choked up
[...]



When the sun goes down

Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo



So when I'm all choked up

When you look at me
And the whole world fades
I'll always remember us this way	##lyrics_samiha

Hast du etwas Zeit für mich
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von neunundneunzig Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont


Denkst du vielleicht grad an mich
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von neunundneunzig Luftballons
Und, dass so was von so was kommt



Yeah-yeah


Neunundneunzig Luftballons

Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man für UFOs aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General


'Ne Fliegerstaffel hinterher
Alarm zu geben, wenn's so wär'
Dabei waren dort am Horizont
Nur neunundneunzig Luftballons


Yeah-yeah



Neunundneunzig Düsenflieger
Jeder war ein großer Krieger
Hielten sich für Captain Kirk
Das gab ein großes Feuerwerk

Die Nachbarn haben nichts gerafft
Und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
Auf neunundneunzig Luftballons  



Yeah-yeah


Neunundneunzig Kriegsminister

Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich für schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute


Riefen Krieg und wollten Macht
Mann, wer hätte das gedacht
Dass es einmal soweit kommt
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons


Oh, yeah
Neunundneunzig Jahre Krieg

Ließen keinen Platz für Sieger
Kriegsminister gibt's nicht mehr
(Und auch keine Düsenflieger)


Heute zieh' ich meine Runden
Ich seh' die Welt in Trümmern liegen
Hab 'n (Luftballon gefunden)
Ich denk' an euch und lass' ihn fliegen

Today is gonna be the day

That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody 
Feels the way I do about you now
 
 Backbeat the word is on the street
 That the fire in your heart is out
 I’m sure you've heard it all before
 But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now
  
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how
 
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
And after all
You're my wonderwall
 
Today was gonna be the day

Cerco l'estate tutto l'anno
E all'improvviso eccola qua

Lei è partita per le spiagge
E sono solo quassù in città

Sento fischiare sopra i tetti
Un aeroplano che se ne va




Azzurro
Il pomeriggio è troppo azzurro
E lungo per me

Mi accorgo
Di non avere più risorse
Senza di te

E allora
Io quasi quasi prendo il treno
E vengo, vengo da te

Il treno dei desideri
Nei miei pensieri all'incontrario va

Love is a banquet on which we feed

Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now,
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now


Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us


Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes


Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now,
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now


[ref]




With love we sleep

With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

G.     D7.    Am.    C.   




Gründlich durchgecheckt steht sie da
Und wartet auf den Start, alles klar
Experten streiten sich um ein paar Daten
Die Crew hat da noch ein paar Fragen
Doch der Countdown läuft 

 
 Effektivität bestimmt das Handeln
Man verlässt sich blind auf den andern
Jeder weiß genau, was von ihm abhängt
Jeder ist im Stress
Doch Major Tom macht einen Scherz 

 
Dann hebt er ab und 
 Völlig losgelöst von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff völlig schwerelos 

 
 Die Erdanziehungskraft ist überwunden
Alles läuft perfekt, schon seit Stunden
Wissenschaftliche Experimente
Doch was nützen die am Ende?
Denkt sich Major Tom 

 
 Im Kontrollzentrum, da wird man panisch
Der Kurs der Kapsel, der stimmt ja gar nicht
Hallo, Major Tom, können Sie hören?
Woll'n Sie das Projekt denn so zerstören?
Doch er kann nichts hör'n 

 
Er schwebt weiter
 Völlig losgelöst von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff schwerelos
Völlig losgelöst von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff völlig schwerelos 

 
 Die Erde schimmert blau, sein letzter Funk kommt
Grüßt mir meine Frau, und er verstummt  
 Unten trauern noch die Egoisten
Major Tom denkt sich: Wenn die wüssten
Mich führt hier ein Licht durch das All
Das kennt ihr noch nicht, ich komme bald
Mir wird kalt 

 
Dann hebt er ab und 
 Völlig losgelöst von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff schwerelos
Völlig losgelöst von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff schwerelos
Völlig losgelöst von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff völlig schwerelos  
 Los

Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Now there′s a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.
Shine on you crazy diamond


You were caught in the cross fire of childhood and stardom.
Blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter.
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!




You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.


Well you wore out your welcome with random precision.

Rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions.
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine

   Breathe, breathe in the air
Don′t be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground


  For long you live and high you flyAnd smiles you′ll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it′s time to dig another one

For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race toward an early grave

And the night, the night is yours alone

 If you're on your own in this life

When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry

You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here
 
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
So fuckin' special I wish I was special

I sit and waitDoes an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know
The places where we go When we're grey and old

'Cause I have been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold


So when I'm lying in my bed

Thoughts running through my head
And I feel the love is dead
I'm loving angels instead


And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call, she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead


When I'm feeling weak

And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love


And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

Between the salt water and the sea strands

Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence




In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence




And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence




Fools said I, You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence


And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence	##lyrics_s&g

I am just a poor boyThough my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest


When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know


Lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
Lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie-lie





Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there,



[ref]


Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me, going home



[ref]


In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
I am leaving, I am leaving
But the fighter still remains

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Whoa, whoa, whoa
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray, Hey, hey, hey


We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files

We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home


And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson [...]


Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes

Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret, just the Robinson's affair
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids


Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson [...]


Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon

Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it, shout about it
When you've got to choose
Every way you look at this, you lose


Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you
Woo, woo, woo
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, Hey, hey, hey, Hey, hey, hey

Steal the warm wind, tired friend

Sometimes, far too long for snakes

In my shoes Walking sleep
In my youth, I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away

If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
Drying in the colour of the evening sun
Tomorrow′s rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay

Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are


On and on the rain will fall like tears from a star, like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say how fragile we are, how fragile we are

He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect

The hidden law of a probable outcome

You'd maybe think there's something wrong
I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask I wear is one

Like those who curse their luck in too many places
And those who fear are lost

Und der Haifisch, der hat Zähne
Und die trägt er im Gesicht
Und Macheath, der hat ein Messer
Doch das Messer sieht man nicht


An ′nem schönen blauen Sonntag
Liegt ein toter Mann am Trent
Und ein Mensch geht um die Ecke
Den man Mackie Messer nennt



Und Schmul Meier bleibt verschwunden
Und so mancher reiche Mann
Und sein Geld hat Mackie Messer
Dem man nichts beweisen kann


Jenny Towler ward gefunden
Mit 'nem Messer in der Brust
Und am Kai geht Mackie Messer
Der von allem nichts gewusst


Und das große Feuer in Soho
Sieben Kinder und ein Greis
In der Menge Mackie Messer, den
Man nicht fragt und der nichts weiß


Und die minderjährige Witwe
Deren Namen jeder weiß
Wachte auf und war geschändet
Mackie, welches war dein Preis

Wachte auf und war geschändet
Mackie, welches war dein Preis	##lyrics_jazz-standard

Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
Think of all the great things we would do?



Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way
La-la-la-da-da-da
La-la-la-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da





Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say



[ref]


Just tonight I stood before the tavern

Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me?


[ref]


Through the door, there came familiar laughter

I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts, the dreams are still the same

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special


Last Christmas…

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me


Happy Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you, I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again


[ref]

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on


A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Oh, oh now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we'll see

No, I won't be afraid
Oh, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me 

 
 So darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me, stand by me 

 
 If the sky that we look upon
Should tumble and fall
Or the mountain should crumble to the sea

I won't cry, I won't cry
No, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand
Stand by me 

 
 And darlin', darlin', stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now
Stand by me, stand by me

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson
Jesus loves you more than you will know
Whoa, whoa, whoa
God bless you, please, Mrs. Robinson
Heaven holds a place for those who pray, Hey, hey, hey


We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files

We'd like to help you learn to help yourself
Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home


And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson [...]


Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes

Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes
It's a little secret, just the Robinson's affair
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids


Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs. Robinson [...]


Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon

Going to the candidates debate
Laugh about it, shout about it
When you've got to choose
Every way you look at this, you lose


Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you
Woo, woo, woo
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson?
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, Hey, hey, hey, Hey, hey, hey

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby


Somewhere over the rainbow, Skies are blue,
And the dreams that you dare to dream, really do come true...


Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me


Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly

Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh why can't I?

Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not

'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you


There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name

Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
Don't worry, be happy

Don't worry, be happy now …. 

 
 Ain't got no place to lay your head
Somebody came and took your bed
Don't worry, be happy
The landlord say your rent is late
He may have to litigate
Don't worry, be happy 


I give your my phone number, if you worry, call me anytime 

 
Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style

Ain't got no gal to make you smile
But don't worry, be happy
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
And that will bring everybody down
So don't worry, be happy

 
 Now there is this song I wrote
I hope you learned it note for note, like good little children
Dn't worry, be happy
Now listen to what I said, in your life expect some trouble
But when you worry, you make it double
But don't worry, be happy, be happy now 

 
Put a smile in your face, don't bring everybody down like this 


It will soon pass, whatever it is

And all the things you do
And it was called yellow

So then I took my turn
Oh all the things I′ve done
And it was all yellow

Oh yeah your skin and bones
Turn into something beautiful
D'you know you know I love you so
You know I love you so





I swam across
I jumped across for you
Oh all the things you do
Cause you were all yellow



I drew a line
I drew a line for you
Oh what a thing to do
And it was all yellow

My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by
No month of May, no twinkling stars

Nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain
Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true
My romance doesn't need a thing but you

Stole a key
Took a car downtown where the lost boys meet
Took a car downtown and took what they offered me

To set me free  
 I saw the lights go down at the end of the scene
Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me 

 
Ooh-ooh-ooh

 
 In my scarecrow dreams
When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting the concrete


Be a cartoon heart  

 Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart  

 We'll run wild


We'll be glowing in the dark, 

ooh-ooh-ooh
We'll be glowing in the dark, ooh-ooh-ooh ah 

 

 All the boys, all the girls
All that matters in the world

All the boys, all the girls
All the madness that occurs

All the highs, all the lows
As the room a spinning goes  

 We'll run riot

We'll be glowing in the dark 

 
 Ooh ooh-ooh-ooh (oh)

So we'll soar
Luminous and wired

We'll be glowing in the dark 	##lyrics_coldplay

Von den Plätzchen, die wir lieben? 
Wer hat das Rezept

Na, dann müssen wir es packen 

Einfach frei nach Schnauze backen 
Schmeißt den Ofen an (oh ja!)
Und ran!

Brauchen wir nicht Schokolade

Zucker, Nüsse und Succade 
Und ein bisschen Zimt? 
Das stimmt


Butter, Mehl und Milch verrühren 
Zwischendurch einmal probieren 
Und dann kommt das Ei (pass auf)
Vorbei

Warten wir gespannt

But I'm not the only one

And the world will be as one

No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people

After one whole quart of brandy
Like a daisy, I'm awake
With no bromo-seltzer handy
I don't even shake


Men are not a new sensation
I've done pretty well I think
But this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink




I'm wild again, beguiled again
A simpering, whimpering child again
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I


Couldn't sleep and wouldn't sleep
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I


Lost my heart, but what of it
He is cold I agree
He can laugh, but I love it
Although the laugh's on me


I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And long for the day when I'll cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I


He's a fool and don't I know it
But a fool can have his charms
I'm in love and don't I show it
Like a babe in arms




Love's the same old sad sensation
Lately I've not slept a wink
Since this half-pint imitation
Put me on the blink


I've sinned a lot; I'm mean a lot
But I'm like sweet seventeen a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I


I'll sing to him, each spring to him
And worship the trousers that cling to him
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I


When he talks, he is seeking
Words to get off his chest
Horizontally speaking, he's at his very best


Vexed again, perplexed again
Thank God, I can be oversexed again

Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered am I


Wise at last, my eyes at last
Are cutting you down to your size at last
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more


Burned a lot, but learned a lot
And now you are broke, so you earned a lot
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more


Couldn't eat, was dyspeptic
Life was so hard to bear
Now my heart's antiseptic
Since you moved out of there


Romance, finis, your chance, finis
Those ants that invaded my pants, finis
Bewitched, bothered, and bewildered no more	##lyrics_jazz-standard

We fit together like two birds of a feather
The perfect combination and it couldn′t be better
If you just say the word, I'll leave my lonely world
I′ll fly with you, ladybird



Just like a robin in the harbinger of spring
I'd have this urge to fly since you've given me wings
Please don′t you say goodbye, I′ll have to leave the sky
Just fly with me, ladybird	##lyrics_jazz-standard

I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah


Well your faith was strong but you needed proof

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
She tied you to her kitchen chair
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips, she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah


Baby, I've been here before

I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew you
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah


Well, there was a time when you let me know

What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do you?
But remember, when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath, we drew was Hallelujah
Hallelujah


Maybe there's a God above

But, all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you?
And it's not a cry, that you hear at night
It's not somebody, who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

I know that this could hurt me bad
I know that this could feel like that
But I just can't stop
Let my defences drop

I know that I was born to kill
Any angel on my windowsill
But it's so dark inside
I throw the windows wide
 


I know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Still I don't let go
And fields of flowers grow





Oh, it feels like
I'm falling in love
Maybe for the first time
Baby, it's my mind you blow


It feels like
I'm falling in love
You're throwing me a lifeline
This is for a lifetime, I know


I know that in this kind of scene
Of two people there's a spark between
One gets torn apart
One gets a broken heart



I know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
I know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Still I don't let go

Baby, it's my mind you blow


It feels like
I'm falling in love
You're throwing me a lifeline
This is for a lifetime, I know



Ooh
Ooh (Feels like)
Woah


It feels like
I'm falling in love
You're throwing me a lifeline
Oh, now for the first time
I know I'm not alone

[Intro]


When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be 

 
 Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be 

 
 And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be

For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be 

 
 Let it be [...] 2x


[interlude]

 
 And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me
Shinin' until tomorrow, let it be

I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be 

 
 And let it be [...]

I am just a poor boyThough my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance
For a pocketful of mumbles
Such are promises
All lies and jest
Still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest


When I left my home and my family
I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station
Running scared
Laying low, seeking out the poorer quarters
Where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know


Lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
Lie-la-lie
Lie-la-lie-lie-lie-lie-lie, lie-lie-lie-lie-lie





Asking only workman's wages, I come looking for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there,



[ref]


Then I'm laying out my winter clothes
And wishing I was gone, going home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleeding me
Leading me, going home



[ref]


In the clearing stands a boxer
And a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down
Or cut him till he cried out
In his anger and his shame
I am leaving, I am leaving
But the fighter still remains

That Arizona sky burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and, babe, I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find


So when I'm all choked up
And I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye
Baby, it hurts

When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way




Lovers in the night
Poets tryin' to write
We don't know how to rhyme
But, damn, we try

But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die


So when I'm all choked up

It's another lonely evening 
In another lonely town 
But I ain't too young to worry 
And I ain't too old to cry 
When a woman gets me down

 
Got another empty bottle 
Mmh and another empty bed 
 Ain't too young to admit it
And I'm not too old to lie
I'm just another empty head 

 
 Mmh, that's why I'm lonely
I'm so lonely
But I know what I'm going to do 

 
 I'm gonna ride on
Ride on
(Ride on) standing on the edge of the road
(Ride on) thumb in the air
(Ride on) one of these days I'm gonna change my evil ways
'Til then I'll just keep riding on 

 
Broke another promise 
 And I broke another heart
But I ain't too young to realize
That I ain't too old to try
Try to get back to the start 

 
 And it's another red-light nightmare
Woah, an' another red-light street  
 And I ain't too old to hurry
'Cause I ain't too old to die
But I sure am hard to beat 

 
 But I'm lonely
Lord, I'm lonely  
What am I gonna do?

 
 got myself a one-way ticket
(Ride on) goin' the wrong way

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special


Last Christmas…

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby, do you recognize me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me


Happy Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you, I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again


[ref]

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on


A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover, but you tore me apart
Oh, oh now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von neunundneunzig Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont


Denkst du vielleicht grad an mich
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von neunundneunzig Luftballons
Und, dass so was von so was kommt



Yeah-yeah


Neunundneunzig Luftballons

Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man für UFOs aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General


'Ne Fliegerstaffel hinterher
Alarm zu geben, wenn's so wär'
Dabei waren dort am Horizont
Nur neunundneunzig Luftballons


Yeah-yeah



Neunundneunzig Düsenflieger
Jeder war ein großer Krieger
Hielten sich für Captain Kirk
Das gab ein großes Feuerwerk

Die Nachbarn haben nichts gerafft
Und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
Auf neunundneunzig Luftballons  



Yeah-yeah


Neunundneunzig Kriegsminister

Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich für schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute


Riefen Krieg und wollten Macht
Mann, wer hätte das gedacht
Dass es einmal soweit kommt
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons


Oh, yeah
Neunundneunzig Jahre Krieg

Ließen keinen Platz für Sieger
Kriegsminister gibt's nicht mehr
(Und auch keine Düsenflieger)


Heute zieh' ich meine Runden
Ich seh' die Welt in Trümmern liegen
Hab 'n (Luftballon gefunden)
Ich denk' an euch und lass' ihn fliegen

When your day is long
And the night, the night is yours alone
When you're sure you've had enough
Of this life, well hang on 

 
 Don't let yourself go
'Cause everybody cries
Everybody hurts sometimes

 
 Sometimes everything is wrong
Now it's time to sing along 

 
 When your day is night alone (hold on, hold on)
If you feel like letting go (hold on)
If you think you've had too much
Of this life, well hang on 

 
 'Cause everybody hurts
Take comfort in your friends
Everybody hurts 

 
 Don't throw your hand, oh no
Don't throw your hand

If you feel like you're alone
No, no, no, you are not alone 

 
 If you're on your own in this life
The days and nights are long
When you think you've had too much
Of this life to hang on 

 
 Well, everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody cries
Everybody hurts, sometimes  
 And everybody hurts sometimes
So hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
Everybody hurts

Left a good job in the city
Workin′ for the man every night and day
And I never lost one minute of sleepin'
Worryin′ 'bout the way things might have been

Big wheel keep on turnin'
Proud Mary keep on burnin′
Rollin′, rollin', rollin′ on the river

Cleaned a lot of plates in Memphis
Pumped a lot of tane down in New Orleans
But I never saw the good side of the city
'Til I hitched a ride on a river boat queen

Big wheel keep on turnin′  [...]

Rollin′, rollin′ (yeah), rollin' on the river

If you come down to the river
Bet you′re gonna find some people who live
You don't have to worry ′cause you have no money
People on the river are happy to give

Big wheel keep on turnin' [...]

Rollin′, rollin' (yeah), rollin′ on the river
Rollin' (yeah), rollin′, rollin' on the river

I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her


She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her


A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me




Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
will never die
And I love her

I sit and waitDoes an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know
The places where we go When we're grey and old

'Cause I have been told
That salvation lets their wings unfold


So when I'm lying in my bed

Thoughts running through my head
And I feel the love is dead
I'm loving angels instead


And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life won't break me
When I come to call, she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead


When I'm feeling weak

And my pain walks down a one way street
I look above
And I know I'll always be blessed with love


And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty, just holding your hand


Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your hello
That music I hear
I get misty whenever you're near


Don't you know that you're leading me on?
And it's just what I want you to do
Can't you see that I'm hopelessly lost?
That's why I'm following you


On my own
When I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove
I'm too misty, and too much in love	##lyrics_jazz-standard play_and_melody

There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do
Yes, I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never ever be another you?

Tides that I tried to swim against
Have brought me down upon my knees
Oh, I beg, I beg and plead
Singin' come out of things un said
Shoot an apple off my head
And a trouble that can't be named
A tiger's waiting to be tamed, singin'  


 You are
You are 

 
 Confusion that never stops
Closing walls and ticking clocks
Gonna come back and take you home
I could not stop that you now know
Singin' come out upon my seas
Cursed missed opportunities
Am I a part of the cure
Or am I part of the disease? Singin' 

 
 You are

Other eyes smile tenderly
Still in peaceful dreams I see
The road leads back to you

Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.



Hey Jude, don't be afraid.
You were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
Then you begin to make it better.





And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain,
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder.





Hey Jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
Then you can start to make it better.





So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,
You're waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do,
The movement you need is on your shoulder.





Hey Jude, don't make it bad.
Take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
Then you'll begin to make it
Better better better better better better, oh.

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a Valentine
Birthday greetings bottle of wine  


 If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four  


 You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you  




 I could be handy, mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride


Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more  
 Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four  


 Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck and Dave  




 Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away  


 Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four

My ship has sails that are made of silk
The decks are trimmed with gold
And of jam and spice there's a paradise in the hold

My ship's aglow with a million pearls
And rubies fill each bin;
The sun sits high in a sapphire sky
When my ship comes in

I can wait the years
Till it appears
One fine day one spring
But the pearls and such
They won't mean much
If there's missing just one thing:

I do not care if that day arrives
That dream need never be
If the ship i sing
Doesn't also bring
My own true love to me

There′s a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly  


Why she had to go

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines

So we sailed on to the sun
'Til we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine 

 
 We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine 

 
 And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

 As we live a life of ease 
Every one of us
Has all we need
Sky of blue 
And sea of green 
In our yellow

Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you


She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you


And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years


You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him

Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

Let pedestrians hurry
 With their eyes full of worry,
 In the pools picking out their way,
 They’re surprised at my folly
 Why I am so jolly
 On this gloomy and dull rainy day.
 

 <h3>
Chorus:</h3> I am playing my harmonica
 For all passers-by to hear.
 It’s a pity we’ve a birthday
 Only once a year.
 

 Then a wizard comes flying
 In a blue helicopter,
 He will show me a film in a way,
 Several hundred sweet ices
 He will give me and wish me
 Many happy returns of the day.

An old man turned 98

He won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late
And isn't it ironic, don't you think?



It's like rain on your wedding day

It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's the good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought, it figures  


 Mr. Play It Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down, he thought
Well, isn't this nice?

And isn't it ironic, don't you think?

Well, life has a funny way of sneaking up on you

When you think everything's okay and everything's going right
And life has a funny way of helping you out
When you think everything's gone wrong and everything blows up
In your face  




 A traffic jam when you're already late
A no-smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's meeting the man of my dreams
And then meeting his beautiful wife


And isn't it ironic, don't you think?
A little too ironic
And, yeah, I really do think

The world was on fire and no one could save me but you 
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do 
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you 
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you 


No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart) 
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart) 
With you 
With you  


(This world is only gonna break your heart)

What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you 
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way

A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head

And thought of all the stupid things I'd said


Oh no, what's this?
A spider web and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
The thought of all the stupid things I've done


And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm


Oh no, I see

So I twist and turn
Here am I in my little bubble

No chords yet 


Once upon a time there was a tavern
Where we used to raise a glass or two
Remember how we laughed away the hours
Think of all the great things we would do?



Those were the days, my friend
We thought they'd never end
We'd sing and dance forever and a day
We'd live the life we choose
We'd fight and never lose
For we were young and sure to have our way
La-la-la-da-da-da
La-la-la-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da





Then the busy years went rushing by us
We lost our starry notions on the way
If by chance I'd see you in the tavern
We'd smile at one another and we'd say



[ref]


Just tonight I stood before the tavern

Nothing seemed the way it used to be
In the glass I saw a strange reflection
Was that lonely woman really me?


[ref]


Through the door, there came familiar laughter

I saw your face and heard you call my name
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser
For in our hearts, the dreams are still the same

Try to think that love's not around
Still it's uncomfortably near
My own heart ain't gainin' no ground
Because my Angel Eyes ain't here


Angel Eyes that old devil sent
They glow unbearably bright
Need I say that my love's mis-spent
Mis-spent with Angel Eyes tonight




So drink up all you people
And order anything you see
Have fun you happy people

The drink, and the laugh's, on me




Pardon me, but I gotta run
The fact's uncommonly clear
I gotta find who's now number one
And why my Angel Eyes ain't here.

Cerco l'estate tutto l'anno
E all'improvviso eccola qua

Lei è partita per le spiagge
E sono solo quassù in città

Sento fischiare sopra i tetti
Un aeroplano che se ne va




Azzurro
Il pomeriggio è troppo azzurro
E lungo per me

Mi accorgo
Di non avere più risorse
Senza di te

E allora
Io quasi quasi prendo il treno
E vengo, vengo da te

Il treno dei desideri
Nei miei pensieri all'incontrario va

I want your belly
And that summer feelin'
I don't know if I could ever go without

Du bist wirklich saudumm</a>
Darum geht's dir gut</a>
Hass ist deine Attitüde
Ständig kocht dein Blut</a>
Alles muss man dir erklären
Weil du wirklich gar nichts weißt
Höchstwahrscheinlich nicht einmal
Was Attitüde heißt</a>


Deine Gewalt ist nur ein stummer Schrei nach Liebe</a>
Deine Springerstiefel sehnen sich nach Zärtlichkeit</a>
Du hast nie gelernt, dich zu artikulieren</a>
Und deine Eltern hatten niemals für dich Zeit</a>
Oh-ho-ho, Arschloch!</a>



Warum hast du Angst vorm Streicheln?</a>
Was soll all der Terz?
Unterm Lorbeerkranz mit Eicheln</a>
Weiß ich, schlägt dein Herz
Und Romantik ist für dich
Nicht bloß graue Theorie
Zwischen Störkraft</a> und den Onkelz</a>
Steht 'ne Kuschelrock-LP</a>

   Weil du Probleme hast, die keinen intressieren
Weil du Schiss vorm Schmus'n hast, bist du ein Faschist</a>
Du musst deinen Selbsthass nicht auf andre projizieren
Damit keiner merkt, was für ein lieber Kerl du bist (Oh-ho-ho)


  Deine Gewalt ist nur ein stummer Schrei nach Liebe
Deine Springerstiefel sehnen sich nach Zärtlichkeit
Du hast nie gelernt, dich artizukulieren</a>
Und deine Freundin, die hat niemals für dich Zeit
Oh-ho-ho, Arschloch! Arschloch! Arschloch!</a>

Ich nehm deine Katze und schüttel sie aus
Bis alles herausfällt
Was sie jemals aus meiner Hand fraß
Später klopf ich noch den Teppich aus

Und find ich ein Haar von mir darin
Dann steck ich es einfach ein
Nichts soll dir böse Erinnerung sein
Verraten was ich dir gewesen bin 

 
 Sag nicht, dass das gar nicht nötig wär
Denn schmerzhaft wird es erst hinterher
Wenn wieder hochkommt was früher mal war
Dann lieber so rein und so dumm sein wie weißes Papier 

 
 Auch werd ich in Zukunft ein anderer sein
Als der, den du in mir sahst
Die Hose die du mir gehäkelt hast
Werf ich in den Container der Heilsarmee rein 

 
 Ich ess auf dem Fußboden, aus der Hand
Seh mir jeden Trickfilm im Fernseh'n an
Alles was du nicht magst, lobe ich mir
Ich werd einfach so rein und so dumm sein wie weißes Papier 

 
 Nicht mal das Meer darf ich wiederseh'n
Wo der Wind deine Haare vermisst
Wo jede Welle ein Seufzer
Und jedes Sandkorn ein Blick von dir ist 

 
 Am liebsten wär ich ein Astronaut
Und flöge auf Sterne wo gar nichts vertraut
Und versaut ist durch eine Berührung von dir
Ich werd nie mehr so rein und so dumm sein wie weißes Papier

Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine


Tell her to make me a cambric shirt
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
Without no seams nor needle work
Then she'll be a true love of mine


Tell her to find me an acre of land

Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme
Between the salt water and the sea strands
Then she'll be a true love of mine


Tell her to reap it with a sickle of leather
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme
And gather it all in a bunch of heather
Then she'll be a true love of

   Breathe, breathe in the air
Don′t be afraid to care
Leave but don't leave me
Look around and choose your own ground


  For long you live and high you flyAnd smiles you′ll give and tears you'll cry
And all you touch and all you see
Is all your life will ever be

Run, rabbit, run
Dig that hole, forget the sun
And when at last the work is done
Don't sit down, it′s time to dig another one

For long you live and high you fly
But only if you ride the tide
And balanced on the biggest wave
You race toward an early grave

If blood will flow when flesh and steel are one
Drying in the colour of the evening sun
Tomorrow′s rain will wash the stains away
But something in our minds will always stay

Perhaps this final act was meant
To clinch a lifetime's argument
That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could
For all those born beneath an angry star
Lest we forget how fragile we are


On and on the rain will fall like tears from a star, like tears from a star
On and on the rain will say how fragile we are, how fragile we are

Today is gonna be the day

That they're gonna throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody 
Feels the way I do about you now
 
 Backbeat the word is on the street
 That the fire in your heart is out
 I’m sure you've heard it all before
 But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now
  
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how
 
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
And after all
You're my wonderwall
 
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realised what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now
 
And all the roads that lead you there are winding
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence




In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence




And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people, maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
No one dared
Disturb the sound of silence




Fools said I, You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the wells of silence


And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the sign said, The words of the prophets
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And whispered in the sounds of silence	##lyrics_s&g

Ah, look at all the lonely people (x2)



Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?


All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?


Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?

Ah, look at all the lonely people (x2)



Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

   Ideal und TV
Lässt mich völlig kalt
Und die ganze Szene
Hängt mir aus′m Hals
Da bleib ich kühl, kein Gefühl

Grelle Fummels aus den Fifties, Sixties
Alles hohl und hundsgemein
Auf Skoda oder Fiorucci
Flieg ich nicht mehr ein
Da bleib ich kühl, kein Gefühl

Bloß deine blauen Augen machen mich so sentimental, so blaue Augen
Wenn du mich so anschaust wird mir alles andre egal, total egal
Deine blauen Augen sind phänomenal, kaum zu glauben
Was ich dann so fühle ist nicht mehr normal

Das ist gefährlich
Lebensgefährlich
Zu viel Gefühl




  Insiderfeten, da schlaf ich ein
Ich will auch nicht in London sein
Bei sex and drugs and rock'n roll
Ist das meist ein stumpfer Einfall
Da bleib ich kühl, kein Gefühl

Der ganze Hassel um die Knete
Macht mich taub und stumm
Für den halben Luxus
Leg ich mich nicht krumm
Nur der Scheich ist wirklich reich

Und deine blauen Augen machen mich so sentimental, so blaue Augen
Wenn du mich so anschaust wird mir alles andre egal, total egal
Deine blauen Augen sind phänomenal, kaum zu glauben
Was ich dann so fühle ist nicht mehr normal

And those he plays never suspect

The sacred geometry of chance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance

He may conceal a king in his hand
While the memory of it fades

 If I told her that I loved you
You'd maybe think there's something wrong
I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask I wear is one

Like those who curse their luck in too many places
And those who fear are lost

Take me now baby here as I am
Pull me close, try and understand
Desire is hunger is the fire I breathe
Love is a banquet on which we feed


Come on now try and understand
The way I feel when I'm in your hands
Take my hand come undercover
They can't hurt you now,
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now


Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to lust
Because the night belongs to lovers
Because the night belongs to us


Have I doubt when I'm alone
Love is a ring, the telephone
Love is an angel disguised as lust
Here in our bed until the morning comes


Come on now try and understand
The way I feel under your command
Take my hand as the sun descends
They can't touch you now,
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now


[ref]




With love we sleep

With doubt the vicious circle
Turn and burns
Without you I cannot live
Forgive, the yearning burning
I believe it's time, too real to feel
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now

Until you've loved a love you had to loose
You don't know what love is
 
You don't know how lips hurt
Until you've kissed and had to pay the cost
Until you've flipped you're heart and you have lost
You don't know what love is



Do you know how a lost heart fears
The thought of reminiscing
And how lips have taste of tears
Loose the taste for kissing



You don't know how hearts burn
For love that cannot live, yet never dies
Until you've faced each dawn with sleepless eyes

Give me time and give me space
Give me real, don't give me fake  
 Give me strength, reserve control
Give me heart and give me soul
Give me time, give us a kiss
And tell me your own politik

Open up your eyes

 Give me one 'cause one is best
In confusion, confidence
Give me peace of mind and trust

Sind so kleine Hände
winzge Finger dran.
Darf man nie drauf schlagen
die zerbrechen dann. 

 
 Sind so kleine Füße
mit so kleinen Zehn.
Darf man nie drauf treten
könn sie sonst nicht gehn. 

 
 Sind so kleine Ohren
scharf, und ihr erlaubt.
Darf man nie zerbrüllen
werden davon taub. 

 
 Sind so kleine Münder
sprechen alles aus.
Darf man nie verbieten
kommt sonst nichts mehr raus. 

 
 Sind so klare Augen
die noch alles sehn.
Darf man nie verbinden
könn sie nichts verstehn. 

 
 Sind so kleine Seelen
offen und ganz frei.
Darf man niemals quälen
gehn kaputt dabei. 

 
 Ist son kleines Rückrat
sieht man fast noch nicht.
Darf man niemals beugen
weil es sonst zerbricht. 

 
 Grade, klare Menschen
wärn ein schönes Ziel.
Leute ohne Rückrat
hab'n wir schon zuviel.

 I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own 

 
 I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead, long live the king
One minute, I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
   
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never, never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world 

 
 It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Aw, who would ever wanna be king? 

 
 I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world 

 
 Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

You are the promised kiss of springtime,
That makes the lonely winter seem long.

You are the breathless hush of evening,
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song.

You are the angel glow that lights a star,
The dearest things I know are what you are.



Some day my happy arms will hold you,
And some day I′ll know that moment divine.

When all the things you are are mine 	##lyrics_jazz-standard ##lyrics_samiha

Ooh-....

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep

And dreamed of para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Ooh-.....

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth

Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear, a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'd close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

And dream of para-, para-, paradise...

La, la-la, la-la-la...



So lying underneath those stormy skies
She said, Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, I know the sun must set to rise

This could be para-, para-, paradise
Para-, para-, paradise...

This could be para-, para-, paradise...

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh...

The falling leaves drift by the window
The autumn leaves of red and gold
I see your lips, the summer kisses
The sun-burned hands I used to hold

And soon I'll hear old winter's song
But I miss you most of all my darling

There are places I'll remember
In my life though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain

All these places have their moments
With lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all

And of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares to you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more

Und der Haifisch, der hat Zähne
Und die trägt er im Gesicht
Und Macheath, der hat ein Messer
Doch das Messer sieht man nicht


An ′nem schönen blauen Sonntag
Liegt ein toter Mann am Trent
Und ein Mensch geht um die Ecke
Den man Mackie Messer nennt



Und Schmul Meier bleibt verschwunden
Und so mancher reiche Mann
Und sein Geld hat Mackie Messer
Dem man nichts beweisen kann


Jenny Towler ward gefunden
Mit 'nem Messer in der Brust
Und am Kai geht Mackie Messer
Der von allem nichts gewusst


Und das große Feuer in Soho
Sieben Kinder und ein Greis
In der Menge Mackie Messer, den
Man nicht fragt und der nichts weiß


Und die minderjährige Witwe
Deren Namen jeder weiß
Wachte auf und war geschändet
Mackie, welches war dein Preis

Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Now there′s a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.
Shine on you crazy diamond


You were caught in the cross fire of childhood and stardom.
Blown on the steel breeze.
Come on you target for faraway laughter.
Come on you stranger, you legend, you martyr, and shine!




You reached for the secret too soon, you cried for the moon.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Threatened by shadows at night, and exposed in the light.
Shine on you crazy diamond.


Well you wore out your welcome with random precision.

Rode on the steel breeze.
Come on you raver, you seer of visions.
Come on you painter, you piper, you prisoner, and shine

My funny valentine
Sweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart



Your looks are laughable
Unphotographable
Yet, you're my favorite work of art



Is your figure less than Greek?
Is your mouth a little weak?
When you open it to speak
Are you smart?



But don't change your hair for me
Not if you care for me
Stay, little valentine, stay
Each day is Valentine's Day	##lyrics_jazz-standard ##lyrics_samiha play_and_melody

Summertime, and the livin' is easy
Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
Oh, your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
So hush little baby, don't you cry


One of these mornings, you're goin' to rise up singin'
And you'll spread your wings and you'll take the sky
But 'til that mornin', there's a-nothin' can harm you
With daddy and mommy standin' by	##lyrics_jazz-standard

Saying I love you

Is not the words I want to hear from you

It's not that I want you
Not to say but if you only knew


How easy, it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know


What would you do
If my heart was torn in two?
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real


What would you say
If I took those words away?
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you


La-di-da, da-di-da
Di-dai-dai-da
More than words
La-di-da, da-di-da





Now that I've tried to
Talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands 


and touch me Hold me close, don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
'Cause I'd already know


What would you do
[...]


What would you say

In my eyes Indisposed
In disguises no one knows
Hides the face Lies the snake
And the sun in my disgrace

Boiling heat Summer stench
Neath the black, the sky looks dead
Call my name Through the cream
And I'll hear you scream again  


 Black hole sun
Won't you come
And wash away the rain?
Black hole sun
Won't you come
Won't you come

 
 Stuttering Cold and damp
Steal the warm wind, tired friend
Times are gone For honest men
Sometimes, far too long for snakes

In my shoes Walking sleep
In my youth, I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away
No one sings like you anymore

Hang my head Drown my fear
Till you all just disappear

G.     D7.    Am.    C.   




Gründlich durchgecheckt steht sie da
Und wartet auf den Start, alles klar
Experten streiten sich um ein paar Daten
Die Crew hat da noch ein paar Fragen
Doch der Countdown läuft 

 
 Effektivität bestimmt das Handeln
Man verlässt sich blind auf den andern
Jeder weiß genau, was von ihm abhängt
Jeder ist im Stress
Doch Major Tom macht einen Scherz 

 
Dann hebt er ab und 
 Völlig losgelöst von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff völlig schwerelos 

 
 Die Erdanziehungskraft ist überwunden
Alles läuft perfekt, schon seit Stunden
Wissenschaftliche Experimente
Doch was nützen die am Ende?
Denkt sich Major Tom 

 
 Im Kontrollzentrum, da wird man panisch
Der Kurs der Kapsel, der stimmt ja gar nicht
Hallo, Major Tom, können Sie hören?
Woll'n Sie das Projekt denn so zerstören?
Doch er kann nichts hör'n 

 
Er schwebt weiter
 Völlig losgelöst von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff schwerelos
Völlig losgelöst von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff völlig schwerelos 

 
 Die Erde schimmert blau, sein letzter Funk kommt
Grüßt mir meine Frau, und er verstummt  
 Unten trauern noch die Egoisten
Major Tom denkt sich: Wenn die wüssten
Mich führt hier ein Licht durch das All
Das kennt ihr noch nicht, ich komme bald
Mir wird kalt 

 
Dann hebt er ab und 
 Völlig losgelöst von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff schwerelos
Völlig losgelöst von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff schwerelos
Völlig losgelöst von der Erde
Schwebt das Raumschiff völlig schwerelos  
 Los
Los
Los
Los

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse 

 

 And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse? 

 

 Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you 

 
 And high up above, or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth 

 

 Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you 

 

 Tears stream down your face

When you lose something you cannot replace

Tears stream down your face, and I 


 

 Tears stream down your face
I 
promise you I will learn from my mistakes

Tears stream down your face, and I 

 

 Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you 	##lyrics_coldplay
